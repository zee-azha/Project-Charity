              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>

                  When Charity starting working in the vast archipelago in 1948, the organisation focused on providing emergency assistance to avert a famine on the island of Lombok.</p>

<p>A year later, the first official cooperation agreement was signed with the Republic of Indonesia to build a milk kitchen in Yogyakarta, the seat of the new government at that time.

In 1969, the Government of Indonesia launched its first Five Year Development Plan, with CHARITY and other UN organizations providing technical assistance.

              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>Our current country programme (2016–2020) is based on equity. It works to realize the rights for children – especially for the most deprived and excluded – as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and articulated in Indonesia's National Medium-Term Development Plan. We support the Government to put children first and invest in children’s survival, development and protection.     
<p>We assist our partners to monitor and measure progress against these rights via the child-focused Sustainable Development Goals, with an emphasis on the most vulnerable children. Our programme interventions are rights-based, cut across different sectors, respond to the specific needs of girls and boys and address the vulnerabilities and strengths of children in their first and second decades of life.</p>
